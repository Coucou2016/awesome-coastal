# awesome-coastal
This is a list of resources which coastal engineers and scientists might find useful. Since we're a fairly niche discipline, it's often difficult to find out about all the great things out in the community! This list brings together useful data-sets, tools and scripts that people might not have been aware of.

### Contributing
If you have any resources that could be useful for coastal engineers and scientists please let us know! This list is mainly focussed on data-sets and software packages that have been developed (and less so on listing papers, reports or books). Contributing can be done in one of two ways:

1. If you're comforatable with Github, make a [pull request](https://github.com/chrisleaman/awesome-coastal/pulls)
2. Or else, open a [new issue](https://github.com/chrisleaman/awesome-coastal/issues)
3. You pull request or issue should provide a link to a resource and a description of what it does and why it might be useful.
